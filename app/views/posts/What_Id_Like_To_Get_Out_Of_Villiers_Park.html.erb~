        <h3>Making the most of Villiers Park</h3>
        <p>On a general level, I would like to experience the different, (perhaps more dynamic) style of learning that Villiers Park offers as a contrast to the standard sixth form teaching I am used to on a day-to-day basis. Possessing relatively little programming knowledge at this moment in time, Iâ€™d like to understand, and be in a position to apply, the basics of programming confidently and successfully. Following from this, I hope to get to grips with Ruby to the point where I can compare and contrast with my use of Python and thus be able to reason which of the languages would be better to use for the sunscreen product development program I am writing under the CREST scheme. I am also hoping that an increased understanding of programming through Ruby will help me to overcome the difficulties I am having with writing in Python i.e. with regards to importing modules. From the skills perspective, I am hoping that working up to the presentation on Friday will help improve my ability to absorb and reflect on new and complex ideas rapidly and communicate them effectively. The mathematical side of the letter I hope will increase my enthusiasm for the subject.</p>
